This python/freecad script generates an ONERA M6 wing. The script generates a file with .geo extension to be read by Gmsh mesh generator.

The geometry is based on https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/wind/valid/m6wing/m6wing.html.
For boundary conditions see https://su2code.github.io/tutorials/Inviscid_ONERAM6.

## Tested on
